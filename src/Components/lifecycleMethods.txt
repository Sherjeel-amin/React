There are 4 Life Cycle methods

Mounting - When an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM
- constructor(props)
- static getDerivedStateFromProps(props,state)
- render()
- componentDidMount()

Updating - When a component is being re-rendered as a result of changes to either its props or state
- static getDerivedStateFromProps(props,state) - called when component is rerendered
- shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) - compare the state values
- render()
- getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState)
- componentDidUpdate(prevProps,prevState,snapshot)

Unmounting - When a component is being removed from the DOM
- componentWillUnmount - Clean up tasks, removing event handlers, never call setState method

Error Handling - When there is an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any child component
- getDerivedStateFromError(error)
- componentDidCatch(error,info)
